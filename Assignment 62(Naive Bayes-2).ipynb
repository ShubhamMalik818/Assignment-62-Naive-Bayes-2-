    "                          such as 0 or 1, true or false, or present or absent.\n",

    "Q3. How does Bernoulli Naive Bayes handle missing values?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS- Bernoulli Naive Bayes handles missing values by assuming that the missing values are equal to 0. This is because Bernoulli Naive Bayes \n",
    "    assumes that the data is binary, and 0 is the default value for a binary feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if a feature is \"smoker\" and the value is missing, Bernoulli Naive Bayes will assume that the person is not a smoker. \n",
    "This is because the probability of a person being a smoker is typically much lower than the probability of a person not being a smoker.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few other ways to handle missing values in Bernoulli Naive Bayes. One way is to impute the missing values. This means that you \n",
    "can replace the missing values with some other value, such as the mean or median of the feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to handle missing values is to omit the features with missing values. This means that you will not use the features with \n",
    "missing values when you are training the Bernoulli Naive Bayes classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to handle missing values in Bernoulli Naive Bayes depends on the specific dataset that you are using. If you have a small \n",

    "\n",
    "1. Not always accurate: The accuracy of the classifier may be reduced if the missing values are not representative of the data.\n",

    "Q4. Can Gaussian Naive Bayes be used for multi-class classification?\n",
